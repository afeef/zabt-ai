# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Auth to Supabase Cloud & Repurpose Backend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) -- *Exceptions made for user-provided terms (FastAPI, Docker-compose)*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification *(Reviewed and passing)*

## Notes

- All items pass checklist validation. The specification is complete, robust, and correctly covers the architectural mandate given by the user, while minimizing implementation leakages aside from explicit user constraints like FastAPI/Docker Compose.
